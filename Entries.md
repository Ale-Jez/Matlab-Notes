## Getting a particular matrix entry

A =

     1     2     3     4
     5     6     7     8
     9     0     1     2
     3     4     5     6
     7     8     9     0

**A(2,3)** gets the entry from the second column and the third row

ans =

     7

**A(9)** gets the ninth entry from the matrix 

ans =

     4

## Manipulating entries


**A(2,3)=7** changes the entry's value to seven

A =

     1     2     3     4
     5     6     7     8
     9     0     1     2
     3     4     5     6
     7     8     9     0

**A(4,5) = 17**
there was no fifth column in this matrix so it is added with an entry which was defined, other entreis of the fifth column are initialized to zeros

A =

     1     2     3     4     0
     5     6     7     8     0
     9     0     1     2     0
     3     4     5     6    17
     7     8     9     0     0
